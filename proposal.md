# Major Project Proposal

## Description
Awesome Tanks-esque game (inspiration: Cool Math Games)
- Awesome Tanks is a well known 2D shooter game on Cool Math Games, with 15 unique levels.
  The primary objective of this game is to destroy all the enemy tank spawners without dying.
  Through killing enemies and breaking crates, the player earns gold, which they can then spend
  on upgrading specific attributes (armor, visibility, turret speed, movement speed). The character movement
  is standard WASD, shooting requires mouse click, and the numbers 1-6 are used to switch weapons.

## Needs to Have List
- Sound effects/background music
- All start screens and/or choice screens
- Implement optional upgrades to your tank (armor, visibility, turret speed, movement speed)
- Implement choice of weapons (minigun, shotgun, ricochet, cannon, rockets, laser)
- Basic movement, shooting, and level layouts
- Spawn enemies periodically until the spawner is broken
- Enemies track player (hard)

## Nice to Have List
- Achievements/stats
- An overheat feature for the gun
- Explosive canisters (AOE damage)
- Healthbars for everything (blocks, enemies, player)
- Freezing ability (freezes the enemy for a certain time after player has picked up the object)
